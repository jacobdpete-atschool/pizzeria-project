            <p>The NYPE can trace its origins to the city-state of Ur in ancient Mesopotamia - and you may know our founder! Ea-nāṣir, famous for his profession as a copper merchant, had a side hustle circa 1750 BC: pizza.</p>
            <p>"Big Pizza" won't tell you this, but pizza is a Mesopotamian invention credited to the greatest copper merchant of all time.</p>
            <p>Ea-nāṣir's side hustle continued under the direction of his sons until the fall of Babylon upended Mesopotamia, resulting in the business fleeing to Rome. Under Roman rule, the pizza enterprise prospered, becoming what can be credited as the first ever franchised business with multiple locations across the Empire.</p>
            <p>The fall of the Western Roman Empire sent the business east to the Byzantine Empire, where the company survived in its last location in Constantinople. In Constantinople, the business became an outspoken critical force against Constantine XI, resulting in their forced exile to Prague.</p>
            <p>In Prague, the company entered a long period of financial hardship that led the company to disband. In 1629, the company reorganized under Ea-nāṣir LVI, who closed all of their remaining locations and moved the company to Virginia.</p>
            <p>The Pizza Emporium, as it was now called, moved in 1766 for one final time to New York City, where it has remained ever since.</p>
